The objective of this project is to build a Covid 19 Detection system that will detect the Covid of the  person by using x ray images.

# Project Overview
According to the world health organization, the coronavirus epidemic threatens the world's health system 
every day. Health resources in most countries are either insufficient or not fairly shared. There are various 
problems such as the number of health personnel, the number of beds, or the number of intensive care units. 
Using limited resources at the optimum level is the key to the country's health systems to overcome this 
epidemic. Disease detection is an important factor in preventing the epidemic. The higher the success, the 
more controlled the spread of the virus. Whether the person has a virus or not is usually done by the PCR 
test. In addition to the PCR method, chest x-ray images can be classified with deep learning methods. The 
COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the health and well-being of the global 
population. A vital step in the combat towards COVID-19 is a successful screening of contaminated 
patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiological imaging using chest radiography. This 
study aimed to automatically detect COVID‐19 pneumonia patients using digital chest x‐ ray images while 
maximizing the accuracy in detection using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). The dataset 
consists of 2614 COVID‐19, 3509 normal chest x‐ray images. In this study, DCNN based model Inception 
V3 with transfer learning have been proposed for the detection of coronavirus pneumonia infected patients 
using chest X-ray radiographs The results demonstrate that transfer learning proved to be effective, showed 
robust performance and easily deployable approach for COVID-19 detection.
